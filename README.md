## About Me

Hi, I'm **Cedric**, a 17-year-old student currently attending the **Bénédict School in Zurich**, where I am completing my education in computer science.

I enjoy learning how software and infrastructure work together to create efficient solutions. Whether it's building websites for businesses or experimenting with backend tools, I like understanding the full development process.  
I see programming as an opportunity to solve problems, automate tasks, and create tools that are useful in everyday life and business environments.

I speak **German and English fluently**, which helps me communicate effectively in international projects and understand technical documentation in both languages.

It integrates multiple APIs, including **GPT** for dynamic prompt generation and **Twilio** for SMS communication.

### Bewerbungsautomator  
A tool that automates the creation of personalized job application dossiers.  
It retrieves company information via APIs and generates tailored motivation paragraphs using AI models. The tool then integrates the adapted application letter with your CV and certificates into a single PDF dossier.  
The final output is a professional, company-specific application named in the format:  
**`Bewerbungsdossier(CompanyName)CedricRoeseler.pdf`**.  
The goal is to save time and ensure high-quality, customized applications with just one click.
