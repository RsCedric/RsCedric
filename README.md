## About Me

Hi, I'm **Cedric**, a 17-year-old student currently attending the **Bénédict School in Zurich**, where I am completing my education in computer science.

I enjoy learning how software and infrastructure work together to create efficient solutions. Whether it's building websites for businesses or experimenting with backend tools, I like understanding the full development process. I see programming as an opportunity to solve problems, automate tasks, and create tools that are useful in everyday life and business environments.

I speak **German and English fluently**, which helps me communicate effectively in international projects and understand technical documentation in both languages.

## Current Projects

Currently no active projects.  
*(I will update this section soon with upcoming website and software projects.)*

## Completed Projects

- **Mont Blanc Zug Website**  
  [mont-blanc-zug.ch](https://mont-blanc-zug.ch)  
  Developed a user-friendly, responsive website for the popular Mont Blanc Cafeteria in Zug. The website provides clear navigation for visitors and a modern design that reflects the café's identity.

## Skills

During my studies I have learned and worked with:

- **React** – building interactive user interfaces and front-end applications
- **Artificial Intelligence** – understanding concepts and implementing basic AI solutions
- **Programming Languages:** C++, Java – for object-oriented programming and software development
- **Web Development:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript – creating structured, styled, and dynamic web pages
- **Docker** – containerizing applications to simplify deployment and improve scalability

I am continuously expanding my skill set through personal projects and by applying what I learn to practical applications.
